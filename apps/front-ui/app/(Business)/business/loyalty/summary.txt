  Proposed next steps
I can implement minimal backend changes to match the frontend queries without breaking existing behavior:

Add paginated response types and resolver methods for:
paymentTransactions(filters) -> PaginatedPaymentTransactionsResponse with items, total, page, limit.
recharges(filters) -> PaginatedRechargesResponse.
pointsTransactions(clientId, page, limit) -> PaginatedPointsTransactionsResponse.
Add alias/compute fields:
LoyaltyProgramEntity: pointsPerDollar (alias of pointsPerPurchase).
AccountRechargeEntity: status (string), transactionDate (Date), qrCode (string) via @ResolveField returning computed values for now.
PaymentTransactionResolver: @ResolveField postTransaction to return the first/last postTransactions element and map to fields expected.
Add alias mutations:
createRecharge -> call service.create.
processRecharge -> return same entity for now or adjust with a trivial “processed” change in-memory.
Before I start, a quick confirm:

Should I add temporary computed fields (status, transactionDate, qrCode) for AccountRecharge until DB migration, or do you want full DB changes now?
For postTransaction, should I pick the latest by createdAt as the single item?
